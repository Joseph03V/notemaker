# NoteMaker

## Description
this program allows you to create,view,and delete notes. It uses heroku for deployment and express module.

## Instalation
No instillation is needed for this project you can just click on the link.

## Usage
This project can be put to a variety of uses. For one, it can be used for all types of memorization.
Grocery list,important dates, tasks, anything you need to keep track of can be put in the notes app.

## future Implementations
In the future i'd like to get the delete working. When using insomnia, i can delete request and also set notes to have their own id.
But for some reason on the actual application they can't be deleted. It just seems totally functional in insomnia, but deployed is different.
